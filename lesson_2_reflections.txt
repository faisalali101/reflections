Q.	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A.	When I initialize a repository, a metadata folder is generated which helps track all the files present inside repository.
	That will help maintain a history of all the commits made to the repository and help in versioning.
	
Q.	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A.	Staging area is an intermediate area between repository and working directory.
	It helps decide which changes are to be moved from working directory on PC to repository.
	Once, all files necessary are added to staging area from working directory using git add command;
	all files can be committed at once to repository by using git commit command.
